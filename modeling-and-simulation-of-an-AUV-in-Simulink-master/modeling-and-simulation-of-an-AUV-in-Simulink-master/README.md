# AUV Demo
Last revised: May 14th, 2021

Welcome to the AUV Demo.

This demonstration project covers a few sections of the entire development worflow for an autonomous underwater vehicle and includes several reference examples that are provided for exploration of different MathWorks&reg; tool capabilities.

**Highlighted Workflow Sections:**
- Developing the Digital Thread
- Modeling the Vehicle Platform
- Designing Control Algorithms
- Developing Autonomous Navigation Algorithms
- Connecting with 3D Virtual Environments

**Instructions:**
1. After cloning the repository to your local computer, navigate to the project folder in MATLAB&reg;.
2. To start the demo, run the **startAUVDemo.m** script. This script opens the project file which automatically sets your MATLAB&reg; path to give you access to all the necessary folders, as well as opens a MATLAB&reg; Live Script that will allow you to navigate through the different sections and examples included in the package.

**Requirements:**
The examples in this demonstration project require MATLAB&reg; Release 2020b or later
